- The Azure equivalent of Datadog for monitoring and observability is `Azure Monitor`, which includes services like `Application Insights` and `Log Analytics`. These tools provide metrics, logs, distributed tracing, and alerting, similar to Datadog.
1. **Azure Monitor (Metrics & Logs)**
- Equivalent to: Datadog Metrics & Logs
- Azure Monitor collects, analyzes, and visualizes logs and performance metrics from Azure resources.
- **Key Features**
  - Metrics & Dashboards – Monitor CPU, memory, network usage across VMs, Functions, Kubernetes
  - Log Aggregation – Centralized logging from Azure resources using Log Analytics
  - Alarms & Notifications – Alerts via Azure Monitor Alerts (integrates with Teams, Slack, or email)
  - Event-Driven Actions – Automatically trigger Azure Functions on anomalies
- **Example:** Monitor Azure Function Logs
  - Go to Azure Portal → Monitor → Metrics
  - Select a resource (e.g., Function App, VM, AKS)
  - Create a dashboard to visualize key metrics.
    
2️. **Azure Application Insights (APM & Tracing)**
- Equivalent to: Datadog APM (Application Performance Monitoring)
- Azure Application Insights provides deep application monitoring with distributed tracing, request analysis, and error tracking.
- **Key Features**
  - Distributed Tracing – Monitors API requests across Azure services (App Service, Functions, CosmosDB)
  - Performance Monitoring – Detects slow responses and high latency
  - Live Metrics & Error Tracking – Real-time visibility into failures and exceptions
- **Example:** Enable App Insights in Azure Function
  - Navigate to Azure Function App → Monitoring → Application Insights
  - Enable Application Insights and choose a Log Analytics Workspace
  - Add telemetry tracking to your code:
  ```
  const appInsights = require("applicationinsights");
  appInsights.setup().start();
  const client = appInsights.defaultClient;
  
  module.exports = async function (context, req) {
      client.trackEvent({ name: "FunctionExecuted", properties: { requestId: context.invocationId } });
      context.res = { status: 200, body: "Hello from Azure Function!" };
  };
  ```
3️. **Azure Log Analytics (For Custom Queries & Dashboards)**
- Equivalent to: Datadog Log Management
- Azure Log Analytics collects, queries, and visualizes log data from multiple sources.
- **Example:** Query Logs for Errors
  - Open Azure Monitor → Logs
  - Use Kusto Query Language (KQL):
  ```
  AzureDiagnostics 
  | where Message contains "ERROR"
  | summarize count() by Resource
  ```
